# Carla SemiTruck and Trailer

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq825QASvZ4)

Run it under windows 10 with carla 0.0.13 and unreal 4.26

This version is still under construction!  

Problems:

- Some time the truck gets stuck, (it looks like it is stuck in the floor)
- Spawning the combination in the world could give problems because I did not take the length into account. So the trailer could be placed on an other vehicle
- Cornering with the tractor,does not take into account that there is a trailer behind the truck, so corner me be cut off.



## Put the files in the right place

The whole directory structure and files nee to be copied in to the root folder of Carla.

## Add the Truck and trailer to the Blueprint Library

You also need to add the vehicle to the Blueprint Library.

As described in the [carla docs](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_A_add_vehicle/#import-and-configure-the-vehicle) in the section : 9. Add the vehicle to the Blueprint Library.

**9. Add the vehicle to the Blueprint Library**.

**<u>*Point 4. (below) is important*</u>**!

> 1. In `Content/Carla/Blueprint/Vehicle`, open the `VehicleFactory` file.

## Test the vehicle

### Manual driving

Launch CARLA, open a terminal in `PythonAPI/examples` and run the following command:

```sh
python manual_controlSemiTrailer.py
```

Note

Even if you used upper case characters in your make and model, they need to be converted to lower case when passed to the filter.

### Generate traffic

Not sure if the below line is correct. Pease try it.

```sh
python generate_trafficsemiTrailer.py -n5
```
### Manual coupling
If you want to couple the tractor to the trailer manually you should place a trailer in the world and then run the standard manual_control.py with the option --filter dafxf
```sh
python manual_control.py --filter dafxf
```
Then drive backwards with the tractor to the front of the trailer and it will couple. It needs a lot of improvement, but it works.
